        <p class="classP1">Despite being part of the most diverse class in the school we felt subtle racism. Not from each other, but from our educators.</p>
      </figure>
      <figure class="classFig2">
        <p class="classP2">This class was held to a different standard. Treated differently. When interacting with children from other classes, it was clear that some teachers had undermined us solely based upon the color of our skin and our ethnic backgrounds. This class was made up of people from all over the world with a spectrum of skin tones. From the Philippines to the Caribbean.</p>

    <p class="middleText">Amongst ourselves we were always comfortable, however when we were forced to interact with other children we felt different. Children with paler skin and white ethnic backgrounds were tended to with care, ate first during meals and had the best roles in school plays. While we would be left to clean up after said meals and school gatherings. </p>

        <p class="peaceP"> All children deserve to be treated fairly regardless. Racial bias should not dictate the level of care one receives. We hoped for better days, to no longer feel different from others. We had desired to no longer be excluded.</p>

    <p class="endText">  In order to prevent such experiences from happening to other children, I believe it is important for anti-racism to be enforced in schools and within school curriculums. Humans are not born understanding the concept of race, it is taught. As it is embedded within society, we must actively put in work to dismantle the negative affects of race.
